# 📊 loan-default-risk-project - Predict Loan Default Risk Easily

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **loan-default-risk-project**! This project helps you understand how likely a borrower might default on a loan using machine learning. We use logistic regression, a popular method for prediction. The project is built with **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**. It includes full data analysis, model evaluation, and even a live demo.

## 🛠️ Features
- Predicts loan default risk using machine learning.
- Uses logistic regression for accurate predictions.
- Includes comprehensive data analysis for understanding factors.
- Live demo available for hands-on experience.

## 📊 Understanding Loan Default Risk
Loan default risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to pay back a loan. This application uses historical data and factors such as credit score, income, and loan amount to predict this risk accurately.

## 📈 How It Works
The application leverages machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, to analyze various loan features. It trains a model on past loan data to understand patterns associated with defaults. Users enter their loan information, and the model gives them a risk assessment.
